# Business Performance & Revenue Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
Multi-branch service business | Sales, Marketing & Operations KPIs

**Main Objectives**

- This dashboard was built to help the CEO monitor revenue performance, customer conversion, and marketing effectiveness across multiple branches.
- The goal was to identify where revenue targets were being missed, which customer sources converted best, and which branch/teams and services drove the highest value, enabling faster, data-driven decisions.

**What I did**

- Modeled sales, customer, marketing, and debt data into a unified Power BI data model
- Built KPIs for revenue vs target, conversion rates, AOV, and debt recovery
- Designed drilldowns from year → month → week to identify short-term performance issues
- Analyzed customer funnel performance by source, service type, and branch
- Created visuals to compare marketing cost vs actual revenue generated

**What I haven't done**
- Simplify the dashboard for a single executive audience; the current version prioritizes analytical completeness over minimalism
- Messy design, because it was some of the very first experiences in a huge project case
- Need better data synchronization rather than a huge data system that relies on Google Sheets

**What I gain**
- Learned how to model complex, huge real-world business data involving sales, customers, marketing, operations, and debt tracking
- Strengthened my ability to translate messy transactional data into clear business KPIs (revenue vs target, conversion rates, AOV, debt recovery)
- Gained experience designing multi-level time analysis (year → month → week → day) to uncover short-term performance issues
- Improved my understanding of customer funnels (lead → visit → purchase) and how performance differs by source, service, and branch
- Developed confidence-building executive-style dashboards that support decision-making across sales, marketing, and operations
- Practiced balancing technical depth and business relevance, a key skill for Business Intelligence and Analytics roles
